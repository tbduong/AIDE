          <strong>AIDE</strong> is a collaborative student project, developed by a group of hardworking and fresh web developers with not only a drive to succeed, but a deep passion to help those in need. For many of us, healthcare is something that resonates within us and something dear in our hearts as many of us have dealt these issues personally, amongst family members or friends.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Many things in our healthcare system can be improved, but to be a part of a group to contribute a small change to make life a little easier for individuals dealing with health issues, is extremely rewarding. AIDE is something that we hope will create a ripple effect for other healthcare companies to recognize and utilize the ever expanding tech industry, smart-phone world, to make healthcare a more accessible for all individuals.
